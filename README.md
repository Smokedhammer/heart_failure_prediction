# heart_failure_prediction
Predicting the possibility of someone dying due to a heart attack. We use streamlit to create this application.

In this simple application, we use the dataset as found here in kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data

We were then able to create a model using Random Forest Classifiers as you can check in the heart failure final directory. Post this, we saved the model and functionalized
it to detect whether or not the person had a chance of passing away due to a heart attack.
